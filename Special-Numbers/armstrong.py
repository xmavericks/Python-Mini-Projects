# This program will tell you the exact logic behind printing all the Armstrong numbers till a range

Which number is exactly said to be an Armstrong number?
---> A number say for example 153 is said to be an Armstrong number only if sum of cube of all the digit is exactly equal to that number
Explanation --:
  digits in 153 are : 1, 5 and 3
  cube of all the digits : 1*1*1 = 1, 5*5*5 = 125, 3*3*3 = 27
  sum of  cubes of all the digits = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153 == original number
----> This kind of numbers are said to be an Armstrong number
