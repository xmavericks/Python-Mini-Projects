Tuples~

Tuples are very similar to lists, except that they are immutable (they cannot be changed).
Also, they are created using parentheses, rather than square brackets.

Example:
words = ("spam", "eggs", "sausages")

You can access the values in the tuple with their index, just as you did with lists:
 
print(words[0]) // gives output as :: spam


Re-assigning value:

Trying to reassign a value in a tuple causes an error.
words[0] = "maggi"

Error message -
