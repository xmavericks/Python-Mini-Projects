# This is a program where you will get to learn behind the scene of find and replace with.
Say for example, we have shortcut key ctrl + H in Notepad++ where we can replace any word or character, with new word.

Example - 

phrase - '''Hi my name is Amod Kumar, I came from Software Engineering Background. I always wanted to be a Scientist but end up becoming an Engineer'''
say, we want to replace name Amod with new name - Mahesh and the entire phrase will be changed for Amod Kumar to for Mahesh Kumar.
