Don't get confused, from the previous pattern

Previous Pattern was :
        1
      1 2  -> Line has increasing value
    1 2 3 
  1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5
Current Pattern:
        1 
      2 2 -> Line has same value, but increased by 1 from previous line, simply means print the number times number of rows - rows 2 , line 2 should be 22 with (rows-2) spaces after
    3 3 3 -> space_count = rows-3, beacuse this is 3rd row, so we substracted 3
  4 4 4 4 
5 5 5 5 5

Now, Since we have already completed writing the program for previous pattern, I will still compare both the programs which will give you what is happening in both codes
